# Enhancement Plan: Real-Time Risk Analytics Dashboard with Predictive Alerts

## Executive Summary

Implement a comprehensive **Risk Analytics Dashboard** with real-time monitoring, predictive risk modeling, and intelligent alerting system. This enhancement will provide traders with deep insights into risk exposure, early warning signals, and automated risk mitigation capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Current system lacks:
- Real-time risk visualization across multiple dimensions
- Predictive risk modeling for early warning
- Correlation analysis between positions
- Stress testing capabilities
- Automated risk-based position adjustments
- Historical risk pattern analysis

## Proposed Solution

### Core Components

#### 1. Real-Time Risk Metrics Engine (`app/risk_analytics.py`)

```python
class RiskAnalyticsEngine:
    """
    Calculates and tracks comprehensive risk metrics in real-time
    """

    def calculate_var(confidence_level=0.95):
        """Value at Risk calculation using Monte Carlo simulation"""

    def calculate_cvar():
        """Conditional Value at Risk (Expected Shortfall)"""

    def calculate_greeks_exposure():
        """Real-time Greeks aggregation across all positions"""

    def correlation_matrix():
        """Position correlation analysis"""

    def stress_test_scenarios():
        """Run predefined stress scenarios (flash crash, volatility spike, etc.)"""

    def calculate_kelly_criterion():
        """Optimal position sizing based on edge and risk"""
```

#### 2. Predictive Risk Model (`app/risk_predictor.py`)

```python
class RiskPredictor:
    """
    ML-based risk prediction using market microstructure
    """

    def predict_drawdown_probability():
        """Predict probability of hitting max drawdown in next N minutes"""

    def detect_regime_change():
        """Identify market regime shifts affecting risk profile"""

    def forecast_volatility_cluster():
        """GARCH-based volatility forecasting"""

    def identify_risk_patterns():
        """Pattern recognition for dangerous market setups"""
```

#### 3. Risk Dashboard UI (`app/pages/risk_dashboard.py`)

**Main Display Sections:**

1. **Risk Overview Panel**
   - Current VaR and CVaR with confidence bands
   - Real-time P&L distribution histogram
   - Drawdown trajectory with predictive cone
   - Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar)

2. **Greeks Exposure Matrix**
   - Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega by strike
   - Heat map visualization
   - Hedging recommendations

3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Position correlation matrix
   - Cluster analysis of correlated risks
   - Diversification score

4. **Stress Testing Results**
   - Scenario analysis grid
   - Maximum loss projections
   - Recovery time estimates

5. **Predictive Alerts Panel**
   - Risk score (0-100) with trend
   - Early warning indicators
   - Recommended actions

#### 4. Intelligent Alert System (`app/risk_alerts.py`)

```python
class RiskAlertSystem:
    """
    Multi-channel alert system with smart prioritization
    """

    def configure_thresholds():
        """Dynamic threshold adjustment based on market conditions"""

    def send_alerts():
        """Discord, Telegram, Email, SMS integration"""

    def prioritize_alerts():
        """ML-based alert prioritization"""

    def suggest_mitigation():
        """Automated mitigation strategy suggestions"""
```

#### 5. Risk-Based Position Manager (`app/risk_position_manager.py`)

```python
class RiskPositionManager:
    """
    Automated position adjustments based on risk metrics
    """

    def auto_hedge():
        """Automatic hedging when risk exceeds thresholds"""

    def dynamic_position_sizing():
        """Adjust position sizes based on current risk"""

    def portfolio_rebalancing():
        """Rebalance to maintain target risk profile"""

    def emergency_liquidation():
        """Smart liquidation in extreme scenarios"""
```
